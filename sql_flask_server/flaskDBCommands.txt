flask db init
  initializes migration directory
flask db migrate
  generate automatic migration scripts as needed to accomodate changes to database structure

DATABASE UPGRADE AND DOWNGRADE
flask db upgrade
  generate or modify database based on migrations scripts generated
  NOTE: when working with database servers (e.g. MySQL or PostgreSQL), need to create the database within the database server FIRST before running upgrade
flask db downgrade
  can be used to roll back schema changes from recent migration scripts, if they are retained

Overall, the workflow of the above 2 commands allows for changes to schema to be easily tested on dev environment, and easily applied to the production server
