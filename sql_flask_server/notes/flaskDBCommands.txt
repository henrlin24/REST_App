.\env\Scripts\activate
flask run

flask db init
  initializes migration directory
flask db migrate
  generate automatic migration scripts as needed to accomodate changes to database structure

-------------DATABASE UPGRADE AND DOWNGRADE
flask db upgrade
  generate or modify database based on migrations scripts generated
  NOTE: when working with database servers (e.g. MySQL or PostgreSQL), need to create the database within the database server FIRST before running upgrade
  default target is 'head', which is a shortcut to the most recent migration
flask db downgrade
  can be used to roll back schema changes from recent migration scripts, if they are retained
  default downgrades one revision
flask db downgrade base
  downgrades all migrations, until database is left at its initial state, with no tables

Overall, the workflow of the upgrade and downgrade commands allows for changes to schema to be easily tested on dev environment, and easily applied to the production server

Can downgrade base, then upgrade to effectively reset database contents as data is not retained during migration

---------------
flask shell
  starts Python interpreter, and allows for incorporation of shell context function
  these can be used to import symbols, such as that within sqltestapp.py
